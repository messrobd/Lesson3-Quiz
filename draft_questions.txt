it is often necessary to repeat a block of code, for example when it needs to be executed
for each of a set of entities. a ?loop is a statement that allows this. python provides 2
loop concepts. a ?for loop iterates over every element in a list. a ?while loop continues until
a defined condition is met; the condition must be calculated in the loop to prevent ?infinite
repetitions.

it is important to structure python code around functions, also known as ?procedures. without it,
?control logic can be complicated and highly nested. functions also allow you to ?reuse code, and
helps you ?test your code.

a ?list is a structured data type in python. lists have many operations in common with the ?string
type, such as index operations. this is because strings are a also lists (of characters).
however, lists differ in an important way: they are ?mutable. this means many variables can refer
to the same list; this is known as ?aliasing. because of this property, a change to a list via one
variable can propagate to other variables.
